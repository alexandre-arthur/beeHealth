# Server
This part of the project is powered by Flask. Flask is a microservice that enables the creation of a web server using Python. One of the advantages of this approach is the flexibility to utilize a wide range of technologies.

In this project, we employ HTML and CSS. We have multiple templates, and thanks to the Jinja template engine, we can customize some aspects. For instance, on the data page, we exhibit all the sounds from the project, each linked to its corresponding analysis page.
